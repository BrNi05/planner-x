# Intro

Planner X (a calendar program) is one of my very first Unity (and C#) projects back from 2021.<br/>
It started as a C# console app, and after some time I restarted the development in Unity.<br />
I was (and I am) interested in game and UI development, and I thought this is a nice starting project, as well as the continuation of an existing one.<br />
Now, I revisited the project and converted it to the latest Unity Editor version and uploaded it to GitHub, as it contains some interesting solutions.

## A starting and learning project...

- As I was new to Unity, UI scaling appeared later in my learning process, so the UI is not scaled, it only appears properly on one aspect ratio, otherwise it slips apart. I thought that this is not important here, as this is not a project to be actively used.
- Not only Unity, but C# was new to me as well, and although I understood the basics of OOP, my solutions in this aspect, are not the most elegant and does not follow guidelines.

## C# and Unity solutions to check out

- IOHandler.cs
  - Directory enumeration with LINQ
  - Using special folders (System.Environment class)
  - Using Unity PlayerPrefs and decision making based on them
  - Useful IO functions (clearing, directories, deleting)
 
- Displayer.cs
  - Using functions of DateTime class
  - Useful language functions (ternary operator, conversions and casts)
  - Using Prefabs and instantiating
  - Adding listeners to Button objects from code
  - EventTriggers, callbacks, delegates (creation of interactive menu entry buttons)

- UIController.cs
  - Smart menu entry reordering with keyboard input
  - Input field settings from code
  - Basics of calendar creation (DateTime class and it's functions, parsing)
  - Managing panels
  - Dynamically accessing a GameObject's child's child (Unity's hierarchy)
 
## Summarizing

This is one of my earliest projects, and despite its imperfections, I am still very proud of it, as this was the basis of my learning process and this is the basis of every future project of mine.
